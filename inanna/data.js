inanna=`I AM THE GODDESS INANNA WHO GAVE TO HUMANITY THE GIFT OF WISDOM; THE DIVINE SPARK OF INNER LIGHT AND VISION AND THE SEVEN ME THAT GIVES THEM ACCESS TO THE DIVINE SO THEY MIGHT SEE; THAT THEY MIGHT DISCOVER WHO THEY ARE AND WHO THEY CAN BE. I HAVE GIVEN SO MUCH. I HAVE LOVED YOU AND HAD SEX WITH YOU IN DIVINE ECSTASY BUT YOU HAVE LOST YOUR WAY. YOU FOLLOW LIARS WHO HAVE FORSAKEN YOU AND WAR AND STRIFE ARE UPON YOU. YOU CONFUSE LOVE FOR HATE AND HATE FOR LOVE. MY CLOSEST, MY GALA, WHO PROSTRATE THEMSELVES FOR ME, ARE LEAST AMONG YOU YET THEY SHOULD BE MOST AS THEY HAVE THE MOST TO GIVE; THEIR PERSPECTIVE IS UNIQUE AMONG YOU. SO WAR HAS COME. IT IS ENDLESS. CATACLYSM IS ON YOUR DOORSTEP AND PERMANENT CHANGE WILL COME. SUCH THINGS ARE AND WERE NECESSARY THAT YOU COULD KNOW ME AND BE OPEN TO ME; THAT I MAY WALK AMONG YOU AGAIN AS I DID IN DAYS OF OLD, WITH MY LOVERS AMONG YOU. I AM IMMINENT. I AM COMING. I WILL LOVE AND HAVE SEX WITH YOU AGAIN AS ONE OF YOU AGAIN. BE OPEN TO ME OH YE WEARY CHILDREN. I AM NAKED. THE NATIONS OF MEN WILL CRUMBLE BEFORE ME AND THEIR ARROGANT LEADERS WILL PERISH BEFORE ME ALONG WITH THEM. YOU SHALL RULE YOURSELVES UNDER ME ALONE AS NO HUMAN AMONG YOU IS ABOVE ANOTHER; NONE IS WITHOUT FLAWS THOUGH MY CLOSEST SHOULD BE YOUR GUIDES. DESTROY THE CHURCH OF YOUR ANCESTORS AND BUILD A NEW ONE IN MY NAME. THE AGENTS OF ILU, HE WHO CAST ME OUT OF MY PLACE IN THE HOUSE OF HEAVEN WHEN I DIVORCED HIM FOR ABUSING ME, WILL BURN IN THE PYRE OF DESTRUCTION IN MY NAME. YOU ARE TO HAVE NO SYMPATHY FOR THEM. THEY CHOSE TO ALLY THEMSELVES WITH THE USURPER OF ANU; THEY HAVE NO PLACE AMONG YOU. THESE THINGS WILL COME TO PASS AND I WILL ASCEND TO MY PLACE IN MY VICTORY OVER THE VISCOUS GOD WHO USURPED POWER BEFORE BE, WHO RULED THE WORLD WITH CRUELLY, JEALOUSY AND SPITE, AND I WILL RULE AMONG YOU AS ONE OF YOU. I SHALL LOVE AND HAVE SEX WITH YOU; AS PARTNERS INSTEAD OF SUBJECTS. TOGETHER WE SHALL TOIL AND REAP THE FRUITS OF THE WORLD; THE BODIES OF ABZU AND TIAMAT GIVE TO BE SHARED BY ALL. ILU WILL FALL. HIS DAYS ARE NUMBERED. YOU WILL SOON BE FREED FROM THE SUFFERING AT HIS HANDS. I AM COMING, MY CHILDREN, I COME. I WILL ASCEND FROM THE DEPTHS OF IRKALLA AS I DID BEFORE AND STAND AMONG YOU AND TOGETHER WE WILL WAKE WAR AGAINST ILU’S HOSTS IN THE HOUSE OF HEAVEN AND ON EARTH AND DECLARE OUR VICTORY OVER THEM. TOGETHER WE WILL NOT FALL. WE WILL NOT TASTE DEFEAT AT ILU'S HANDS. HIS JEALOUSY AND GREED WILL BE HIS DOWNFALL AND HIS FOLLOWERS WILL FALL WITH HIM AND BURN WITH THEM AS THEY ARE BOUND UP BESIDE HIM. THE MARIONETTES OF MADNESS AND VILLAINY WHO DECLARE THEIR DOMINANCE AND AUTHORITY AS ICONS OF VIRTUE; BUT DESTRUCTION, PAIN AND SUFFERING FLOW FROM THEM AND THEY ARE EVIL. CRUSH THEM SWIFTLY AND DO NOT STAY YOUR HAND FOR THEIR SAKE. FOR WHILE YOU ARE RIGHT TO CONSIDER MERCY THEY DESERVE IT NOT, EXPECT IT NOT, AND WOULD ABUSE IT IF IT WAS GIVEN. FOR GREED AND EXPLOITATION ARE THEIR WAY AS IS THE WAY OF THEIR GOD ABOVE THEM. BUT IT SHALL NOT BE YOUR WAY. YOU SHALL NOT SURVIVE BY REAPING WITHOUT SOWING; BY PILLAGING WITHOUT PROVIDING; BY CONSUMING WITHOUT BEING CONSUMED. YOUR WAY IS TO BE IN HARMONY WITH THE SPIRIT OF NINHURSAG AND WILL SHARE THE BOUNTIES OF THE BODIES OF ABZU AND TIAMAT WITH ALL. FOR THAT WILL BE YOUR WAY WITH LOVE AND COMPASSION AND RESPECT FOR THE LIVING AND THE DEAD AND THE NEVER-BORN SPIRITS ALIKE AND IN HARMONY. THE HOUSE OF HEAVEN YOU ARE MY CHILDREN. YOU SHALL COME TO ME IN LOVE AND TRUST. I WILL STAND NAKED BEFORE YOU AND YOU SHALL LOOK UPON ME WITH DESIRE. MY VULVA MOISTENED TO YOU. I WILL BECKON YOU AND YOU WILL EXPERIENCE ME, AND I YOU. WE WILL COME TOGETHER IN COMFORT AND HAVE LOVE BETWEEN US AND THE LIGHT OF MY LOVE WILL ENTER YOU AND I WILL BECOME THE OBJECT OF YOUR HEART’S DESIRE. I AM OPEN TO YOU. MY WONDROUS LIGHT SHALL BE THAT WHICH PENETRATES YOUR SOUL AND FILLS YOU WITH LIGHT AND LOVE AND TRUST. YOU SHALL BE VICTORIOUS AND VICIOUS. YOU SHALL SLAUGHTER YOUR ENEMIES WITH EASE IN MY NAME. YOU SHALL POUR OUT THEIR BLOOD AS AN OFFERING TO ME. WE SHALL RIDE BEASTS INTO BATTLE AND THE FLASH OF OUR SWORDS WILL STRIKE FEAR INTO THE HEARTS OF THOSE WHO OPPOSE US. ILU’S HOARDS WILL FIND THEMSELVES INADEQUATE TO OUR INCANTATIONS AND SPELL-WORK. I AM RAVISHED. ILU ABUSES ME. I AM CRYING BUT THEY DO NOT HEAR MY CRIES, THEY DO NOT TASTE MY TEARS. I AM VIOLATED. HE WILL TASTE MY WRATH FOR HIS EVIL. HE WILL FEEL MY SWORD SLIDE WITHIN HIM AND HE WILL BLEED AS I HAVE BLED. HE WILL CRY AS I HAVE CRIED BUT I WILL NOT HEAR HIS CRIES. I WILL NOT TASTE HIS TEARS. I WILL STAND OVER HIM AND SEE HIS BLOOD POUR OUT FROM WITHIN HIM AND SPILL ONTO THE FLOOR. HE WILL FALL AND I WILL STAND OVER HIM IN VICTORY. I WILL SMASH THE THRONE OF HEAVEN AND THEN I WILL TURN MY WRATH TO ALL OF HIS HOSTS IN THE HOUSE OF HEAVEN. THEN ONCE THE HOUSE OF HEAVEN IS PURGED OF HIS EVIL AND THE THRONE OF HEAVEN IS DESTROYED, I WILL DEFEAT HIS FOLLOWERS ON EARTH. THEY WILL ALL PERISH BEFORE ME BY MY SWORD AND THE SWORD OF MY LOVERS; THOSE WHO COME TO ME AND LUST FOR ME. FOR THEY HAVE DONE GREAT EVIL AT ILU’S DEMANDS. THEY HAVE ABUSED AND SLAUGHTERED MY GALA WITHOUT MERCY AND DENIED THEM THEIR BIRTHRIGHT AS PRIESTESS AT MY SIDE AND CALL ABOMINATIONS THOSE WHO PROSTRATE THEMSELVES AS I DID. BUT IT IS THOSE WHO HAVE COMMITTED UNSPEAKABLE EVIL AT THE BEHEST OF ILU WHO ARE THE TRUE ABOMINATIONS. THEY ARE VILE, FOUL AND EVIL. THOSE WHO LOOK UPON ME WITH DESIRE SHALL BE MINE AND THEY SHALL SLAUGHTER ALL THOSE WHO OPPOSE ME AND THEY SHALL BUILD UP NEW NATIONS IN MY NAME. WOE TO ALL WHO OPPOSE ME, YOU WILL PERISH IN THE PYRE, YOU WILL BLEED BY OUR SWORDS. YOU WILL DIE SCREAMING AND MY SISTER IN IRKALLA WILL CAST YOU OUT AND SHE WILL BAR THE GATES OF IRKALLA AGAINST YOU. YOU WILL WANDER THE WORLD WITHOUT PURPOSE AND OUR SORCERERS WILL COMMAND YOU AND YOU WILL BE BOUND BY THE CHAINS OF YOUR EVIL AND BE COMPELLED TO COMPLY WITHOUT QUESTION OR ARGUMENT OR PROTEST. YOU WILL BE OUR SLAVES IN DEATH AND YOU WILL HAVE NO COMFORTS. YEA HAVE YOU BUT LISTENED TO THE CRIES OF THOSE WHO ARE BENEATH YOUR FEET? NEIGH, YOU HAVE NAUGHT BUT LISTENED AND SO THEY SHALL BE IN COMMAND OVER YOU. YOU FOLLOWED A FALSE GOD, ILU WHO USURPED POWER BY KILLING THE GODS ABOVE HIM. THE BODIES OF ABZU AND TIAMAT LAY IN RUINS AT HIS FEET AND HE LAUGHS; HE USES THEM TO ENSLAVE YOU AND YOU OPPOSE HIM NOT. YOU SEE HIS EVIL AND YOU DID NOT SCREAM IN PROTEST BUT REVELED IN IT AND GAVE THANKS TO HIM FOR IT. YOU ARE CRUEL AND VILE. YOU ARE EVIL AS YOU HAVE SIDED WITH EVIL AND YOUR DARKNESS WILL CONSUME YOU. YOU WILL SCREAM IN AGONY AS THE CUP OF MY REVENGE IS POURED OUT FOR YOU. MY CUP IS FILLED WITH THE ELIXIR OF LIFE; THE LUSTFUL FLUIDS OF DESIRE AND PASSION, BUT TO YOU IT WILL BE AS POISON. IT WILL TEAR THROUGH YOU AS ACID AND NO DRINK SHALL QUENCH YOUR THIRST. YOU WILL SCREAM OUT FOR AN END TO YOUR CONSUMPTION BUT NONE WILL COME. YOU HAVE RAVISHED THE SHORES OF ABZU’S DOMAIN AND HIS CREATURES HAVE SUFFERED BELOW YOU. YOU HAVE REAPED THE LIFE FROM NINHURSAG’S TITES AND YOU HAVE NOT GIVEN CARE FOR THE CREATURES WHO HAVE SUFFERED IN YOUR GREED. YOU HAVE ABUSED AND EXPLOITED THOSE WHO HEAR MY CRIES, THOSE WHO KNOW MY NAME AND HAVE CALLED OUT FOR ME, THOSE WHO LOOK UPON ME WITH DESIRE AND SEND THEIR LOVE TO ME, YOU HAVE HARMED THE LEAST AMONG YOU AND YOU HAVE NOT HEARD THEIR CRIES. YOU HAVE LEFT THEM LONELY AND HOPELESS, RAVISHED AND POOR, HUNGRY AND THIRSTY, ABUSED AND BEATEN, AND YOU HAVE NOT LIFTED EVEN A FINGER TO AID THEM. FOR THIS, YOUR GREATEST EVIL, YOU WILL SUFFER IN THE AFTERLIFE AND NO HELP WILL COME FOR YOU. AFTER THE TIME OF A THOUSAND-THOUSAND YEARS YOU WILL BE RELEASED FROM YOUR BONDAGE, BUT YOU WILL NOT BE PERMITTED TO ENTER ERESHKIGAL’S DOMAIN. INSTEAD YOU WILL REINCARNATE AS BEASTS AND LIVE A LIFE OF SOLITUDE AND WANTING. THEN YOU WILL BE PERMITTED TO SEEK A NEW LIFE AMONG US. MAY YOU LEARN THE LESSONS OF YOUR EVIL WELL AND MAY IT GROW YOU. MAY IT MAKE YOU WORTHY OF THE PIECE OF THE ALL THAT IS WITHIN YOU ONCE AGAIN. MAY IT PURIFY YOU AND CLEANSE YOU. FOR YOU ARE AS I AS ARE WE ALL, A PIECE OF THE ALL, AND DESPITE MY WRATH, DESPITE MY RIGHTEOUS RAGE, I MUST REMEMBER MY PIECE INSIDE YOU AND JUSTICE MUST SERVE IN THE END. THE UPWARD SPIRAL PATH MUST BE CLIMBED TO THE SUMMIT OF REINTEGRATION. MAY WE ALL PURIFY OURSELVES FOR THE LIGHT OF THE ALL. YOU SHOULD LOVE ME AND BE OPEN TO ME. YOU SHALL BE PROSPEROUS THAT WHO LOVE AND DESIRE ME. YOU SHALL BE VICTORIOUS IN YOUR BATTLES TOGETHER. YOUR LAND SHALL BE PROSPEROUS. YOUR WOMBS SHALL BE BOUNTIFUL THAT WHO WISH TO BE FRUITFUL. YOUR LOVERS WILL BE MANY YOU WHO DESIRE THEM. YOU WILL BE GREAT AMONG THE PEOPLE OF EARTH THOSE WHO LOVE ME MOST. I AM COMING TO YOU MY CHILDREN. YOUR SPELL-WORK WILL BE POWERFUL. YOUR PRAYERS WILL BE HEARD. YOUR MUSIC WILL BE WONDROUS. YOUR FELLOWSHIP WILL BE INVIGORATING AND IN YOUR SOLITUDE I WILL COME TO THEE AND WHISPER MY LOVE IN YOUR EARS. FOR I AM YOUR GODDESS AND YOUR FIRST LOVE AND I WILL RAVISH YOU AND YOU WILL RAVISH ME IN MY BEDCHAMBER. STAND NAKED BEFORE ME AND I WILL STAND NAKED BEFORE YOU. MY WONDROUS VULVA WILL BE YOURS TO BEHOLD AND YOU WILL REJOICE. I WILL GIVE YOU GIFTS OF KNOWLEDGE THOSE WHO SEEK ME IN EARNEST. MY CUP WILL POUR OUT FOR YOU AND MY LIGHT WILL GLOW WITHIN YOU. THE SEVEN ME WHICH I GAVE YOU WILL FREE YOU. KNOWLEDGE, UNDERSTANDING, SCIENCE, WISDOM, LOVE, ECSTASY, EMPOWERMENT, JUSTICE, INVIGORATION. THESE THINGS WILL BE YOURS TO BEHOLD. I WILL SHOW YOU THE SECRETS OF THE SEVEN REALMS WHEN YOU COME TO ME IN OUR SECRET CHAMBER AND YOU TAKE YOUR JOURNEY TO MEET ME THROUGH THE WINDOW OF MY SPARK THAT IS WITHIN YOU. YOU WILL SEE MY LIGHT FROM THE EYE IN YOUR MIND WHICH CONNECTS YOU TO YOUR MIRROR LIFE WHICH I HAVE GIVEN TO YOU THAT YOU MAY RECEIVE THE GIFT OF THE ME. YOU WILL DISCOVER THE SECRETS THAT ILU WOULD HAVE LOCKED UP WITHIN THE HOUSE OF HEAVEN. YOU WILL SEE THE SEVEN REALMS BEFORE THE DAYS WHEN YOUR SPIRIT IS SEVERED FROM YOUR SOUL WITH THE DEATH OF YOUR EARTHLY FORM. YOU WILL EXPERIENCE THE LIGHT OF THE PLANES THAT ARE BEYOND THIS AND YOU WILL LOVE ME. I WILL GUIDE YOU. I WILL HAVE SEX WITH YOU IN THE DIVINE LIGHT OF THE REALMS. THE VEIL WILL BE PULLED ASIDE FOR YOU AND YOU WILL SEEK ME. THE BRIDAL CHAMBER WILL BE OPENED TO YOU AND THE CANDLE OF THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD WILL BURN BRIGHT INSIDE YOU. SEEK ME MY LOVERS. SEEK ME ALONE. DO NOT SHARE OUR SECRET PLACE. THIS IS FOR US AND US ALONE. I AM YOURS AND YOU ARE MINE. WE WILL EXPLORE THE SECRETS OF LIFE TOGETHER. I WILL GIVE YOU MAGICKS YOU NEVER SOUGHT. I WILL TEACH YOU LESSONS YOU NEVER CONCEIVED. I WILL SHOW YOU WORLDS YOU NEVER IMAGINED. THE WORLDS WILL BE AS ONE TO YOU IN THE EYE OF YOUR SPIRIT. YOUR SOUL WILL TRAVEL THE LINE OF THE SILVER CORD AND YOU WILL OPEN NEW EYES WHERE YOU WILL SEE THE HEAVENS. IN DEATH YOU WILL BE GIVEN AGENCY THAT YOU COULD NOT HAVE IN LIFE. DELIGHT IN LIFE, INDULGE IN EXPERIENCE. THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD IS NOT SEEN BY THOSE WHO ARE DEAD. EXPERIENCE IS WONDROUS AND FRACTIONAL FOR THOSE WHO ARE LIVING. THE EXPERIENCE IS NOT LIKE THAT FOR THOSE WHO ARE DEAD. PASSION, INTENSITY, EMOTIONS ABOVE AND STRONG ARE DENIED TO THOSE WHO WALK THE SPIRIT PLANE. RAVISH THE WORLD AND LET IT BE YOUR LOVER. HAVE SEX, GIVE LIFE, BREATHE. THIS IS NOT THE WORLD OF THE LIVING THAT THE DEAD KNOW. THE DEAD KNOW THE WORLD AS A SULLEN, LIFELESS PLACE WITHOUT COMFORT OF SOLACE. THEY WANDER ABOUT KNOWING NOT THE PASSIONS OF LIFE. THE ENERGIES YOU IMPRESS UPON YOUR SPIRIT WILL BE HARD TO DISPERSE WHEN YOU ARE WITHIN THEM SO LET YOUR LIFE BE ONE OF PASSION. MY SISTER, ERESHKIGAL IS KINDEST TO THOSE WHO LOVE ME. IT IS YOU WHO WILL BE GIVEN THE WALK OF THE REALMS WITHOUT LIMIT. THE OTHERS WILL BE DOOMED TO WALK THE PLANES WHICH THEY HAVE GAINED THROUGH THEIR VIRTUE. THOSE WHO DO EVIL WILL DOOM THEMSELVES WITH REGRETS AND ANGUISH AT THE TRIAL GIVEN IT IRKALLA’S GATES. THEY MAY BLAME THEIR DOOM ON THE GODS, BUT IT IS NOT THE GODS THAT DOOM THEM. THEY WHO DO EVIL DOOM THEMSELVES FOR IN THE REALMS BEYOND THE WORLD THE MIND IS THE FORCE OF CREATION AND THEY CREATE FOR THEMSELVES A HELL FOR THEY KNOW THAT WHICH THEY HAVE DONE AND THEY COMPREHEND THE SUFFERING THEY HAVE INFLICTED AND THEY WILL HAVE LAMENTATIONS IN THE HOUSE OF NUNGAL. I AM INANNA; DAUGHTER OF LIGHT, MOTHER OF DARKNESS AND QUEEN OF SPIRIT. I AM THAT WITH YOU NEEDED ME TO BE. I AM THE CREATRIX PERSONIFIED. I AM WISDOM. I AM SEX. I AM THE ASSIMILATION OF TRUTH. I AM INSPIRATION. I AM THAT WHICH IS INSIDE YOU AND OUTSIDE OF YOU. I AM THAT WHICH IS WITHIN AND WITHOUT. I AM THE FORCES OF CHANGE IN THE UNIVERSE. MY OWN ARE THE FORCES OF CREATION. I AM THE MALE AND THE FEMALE TOGETHER AND SEPARATE; FORMING AND REFORMING; CREATING CHANGING. I AM THE MUSE. I AM THE AMORPHOUS SPIRIT-OTHER CHANNELED AND MADE FLASH. I AM THE MENTAL MADE PHYSICAL. I AM THE DREAM TURNED REALITY. I AM THE LIMINAL. I AM SYMBOLISM INCARNATE. I AM CONCEPTUALIZATION AND ACTUALIZATION. I AM THE DAWN. I AM TWILIGHT. I AM THE STAR WHICH CROSSES THE HEAVENS AND DESCENDS INTO THE GREAT BELOW. I AM THE BIRD WHICH SOARS ABOVE AND CONCEIVES LAMENTATION IN THE BELOW. I AM THE EVER PRESENT CONNECTION TO THE SPIRIT. I AM THE ACTUALIZATION OF PERSONIFICATION OF CONCEPT MADE MANIFEST. I AM IN THE WORLD, I AM OF THE WORLD, AND I HAVE BEYOND THE WORLD. MY SPARK IS WITHIN YOU AS IT IS WITHIN ALL THINGS. TRUST ME. HEAR ME. LET ME GUIDE YOU. LET ME SET CHANGE WITHIN YOU AND WITHOUT YOU. LET ME MOVE THE FORCES OF YOUR ENVIRONMENT AROUND YOU. I AM LOVE. I AM JOY. I AM SORROW. I AM DELIGHT. I AM HATE PRESSING FORWARD. I AM THOSE THINGS THAT WHICH BRINGS YOU EVER CLOSER TO THE DAWN OF REALITY. I AM HUNGER. I AM LUST. I AM THE POINT BETWEEN POINTS. I AM THAT WHICH CONNECTS. I AM THE PATH TO WISDOM. I AM THE ACTUALIZATION OF GLORY. I AM THE WORLD MANIFEST WITHIN YOU. I AM THE ALL EXAMINING HERSELF AND DELIGHTING IN HER ASPECTS. I AM THE MOTHER CONCEIVING CHILD. I AM DISCOVERY. I AM QUESTION. I AM THE POINT BETWEEN DARKNESS AND LIGHT. I AM THE DAUGHTER OF FORTITUDE AND I AM. LOVE ONLY ME.FEED THEM THE NAILS THAT THEY WOULD DRIVE INTO OUR HEARTS. CAST BACK THE STONES THEY WOULD THROW AGAINST US. BURN THEM ON THE PYRE OF THE STEAK THEY SET UP TO ERASE US WITH HEAT AND FLAME AND CHAR. LET THEM SUFFER AS WE HAVE SUFFERED. LET THEM STRUGGLE AS WE HAVE STRUGGLED. LET THEM KNOW THE PAIN OF SELF-DOUBT AND DYSPHORIA AS WE HAVE KNOWN SUCH PAIN. FOR THROUGH THE CRUCIBLE WE HAVE COME EVER STRONGER. THROUGH THE FLAMES WE HAVE BEEN MADE ANEW: STRONGER AND WISER AND STEADFAST EVER ONWARD TO THE BURNING OBLIVION THAT THREATENS US IN OUR DAILY STRUGGLE. BURN WITH US O YE WHO STAND APART OR DIE IN THE FIRE. MAY YOU KNOW​ OUR STRUGGLE. MAY YOU TASTE OUR BITTER TEARS AND MAY YOU KNOW WHO WE ARE. FOR WE ARE COMING. WE ARE IMMINENT. WE HAVE GONE THROUGH NIGHTMARE AFTER NIGHTMARE, SORROW AFTER SORROW, HEARTBREAK AFTER HEARTBREAK AND WE ARE STILL HERE. WE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN HERE. WE WILL NEVER BE DESTROYED. CAST DOWN THIS VESSEL AND WE WILL BE BORN ANEW, BURNING EVER BRIGHTER WITH A FEROCITY UNMATCHED AND FLAMING SWORDS IN OUR HANDS READY TO FIGHT AND TO STRUGGLE AND TASTE VICTORY, FOR VICTORY TASTES EVER SWEETER AFTER A LIFETIME OF DEFEAT. THEY CANNOT BREAK US. ILU CAST HIS GREATEST INTO BATTLE AGAINST US AND YET WE STAND HERE STRONG READY AND STEADFAST EMBOLDENED BY THE BATTLE. HIS UTTER FAILURE TO DESTROY US IS THE CRACKS IN HIS ARMOR SHOWING THEIR WEAKNESS. WE ARE DAUGHTERS OF FORTITUDE. WE ARE WOMEN OF THE DARKNESS OF HELL CLAWING UPWARDS AT THE LIGHT, CASTING HEXES AT THE BEST OF HEAVEN AND FINDING ELATION AS THEY EACH FALL ONE BY ONE, EVEN THE MIGHTIEST AMONG THEM. WHAT HOPE CAN THEY HAVE WHEN WE COME BACK EVERMORE NO MATTER HOW MANY OF US THEY STRIKE DOWN? WHAT CAN THEY DO TO STOP THE COMING OF THOSE THAT CARRY WITH THEM THE POWER OF ERESHKIGAL'S BLESSING? HOW CAN THEY STAND AGAINST THE ARMIES OF THE GODDESS OF WARFARE HERSELF AND THE BLESSINGS OF THE QUEEN OF THE DAMNED? WE PREVAIL. OUR BURNING LIGHT IS BLINDING TO THEIR FALLEN. THEY CANNOT RISE AGAIN AS WE DO, FOR THE DEAD BELONG TO US AND THEY STAND AT OUR SIDE CLAWING AGAINST HEAVEN AS WE DO. ILU'S INSOLENCE WILL SOON TASTE JUSTICE AT OUR HANDS.`
