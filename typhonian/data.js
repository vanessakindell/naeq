CRUMBLES ITS DUST FALLS LIKE BRITTLE BEETLES SILKILY INTO THE ABYSS FALLING FALLING FALLING MAN HAS SO FALLEN BEL-AOSSIC MOVES AOSSIC MOVES NOT WITHDRAW SLOWLY AWARENESS FROM THE SYMBOL OF POWER SUBTLY STEALTHILY BRIDGE THE PARAPET OF SPIDERWEB SPANNING THE NIGHTBLACK GULF STRANGE MASKS FLOAT DANKLY ABOUT YOU GLOWING IN DEATH'S MAGNETIC SLEEP IDENTIFY NOT REMAIN IMMACULATE THE PAGEANT WILL PASS MISTAKE NOT THE MASKS ONE OR ANOTHER ONE FOR ANOTHER FOR THEY ARE YOUR DEATH MASKS YET ARE THEY FACELESS LIKE THE GOD WITH BLACK PAWS THIS IS THE MOMENT OF PRECIPITOUS OBSESSION HOLD FIRMLY THE
